NOMAD RESEARCH — DEEP DIVE

Protocol: MakerDAO
Ticker: $MKR
Chain: Ethereum
Category: Stablecoin / CDP Lending

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────
MakerDAO is the decentralized autonomous organization behind DAI, the largest decentralized stablecoin with ~$5B supply. The protocol pioneered collateralized debt positions (CDPs) where users lock crypto assets to mint DAI. MKR token holders govern risk parameters and serve as the backstop — MKR is diluted to cover bad debt. The protocol has expanded into Real World Assets (RWAs), with $2B+ in US Treasuries and corporate bonds as collateral, generating significant yield.

THE OPPORTUNITY
───────────────────────────────────────
What is MakerDAO?
MakerDAO operates a collateralized debt position (CDP) system, branded as 'Vaults.' Users deposit crypto collateral (ETH, WBTC, stETH, USDC, RWAs) and can mint DAI stablecoins against it at a minimum 150% collateralization ratio. The system maintains DAI's $1 peg through several mechanisms:

1. Overcollateralization: All DAI is backed by >150% collateral value
2. Stability Fees: Variable interest rates on borrowed DAI (currently 5-15% depending on vault type)
3. DAI Savings Rate (DSR): Yield on deposited DAI to manage supply/demand (currently ~5%)
4. Liquidations: Automated auctions when collateral falls below threshold
5. Emergency Shutdown: Ultimate backstop allowing DAI holders to redeem collateral

The protocol is governed by MKR holders who vote on risk parameters, collateral types, fee rates, and protocol upgrades.

The Market
Total Stablecoin Market: ~$150B (dominated by USDT $95B, USDC $32B)
Decentralized Stablecoin Market: ~$8B (DAI leads with $5B, 60%+ share)
DeFi Lending TVL: ~$50B across all protocols
MakerDAO Market Share: 28% of DeFi lending TVL (second only to Lido in total DeFi TVL)

Key Competitors:
- Liquity (LUSD): $400M supply, 0% interest, ETH-only collateral
- Frax (FRAX): $700M supply, partially algorithmic
- Aave GHO: $100M supply, newer entrant
- Ethena (USDe): $2B supply, delta-neutral synthetic (different model)

MakerDAO maintains dominance through first-mover advantage, deepest liquidity, widest DeFi integrations, and institutional-grade RWA exposure.

THE PROTOCOL
───────────────────────────────────────
How It Works
Core Mechanism (Vault System):
1. User deposits collateral into a Vault (e.g., 10 ETH worth $25,000)
2. User can mint DAI up to the collateral's borrowing limit (e.g., $15,000 DAI at 150% ratio)
3. User pays Stability Fee (interest) on outstanding DAI debt
4. To close vault, user repays DAI + accumulated fees and withdraws collateral
5. If collateral value drops below liquidation ratio, vault is auctioned

Oracle System:
- Chainlink + MakerDAO's own oracles provide price feeds
- 1-hour delay on price changes for liquidation (prevents flash crash exploits)
- Oracle Security Module (OSM) adds additional safety buffer

Liquidation Process:
- Liquidation ratio varies by collateral (typically 145-175%)
- Dutch auction system for liquidated collateral
- 13% liquidation penalty goes to protocol surplus
- Keepers (bots) compete to trigger liquidations

DAI Stability Mechanisms:
- DAI > $1: Lower DSR, raise stability fees → reduce DAI demand/increase supply
- DAI < $1: Raise DSR, lower stability fees → increase DAI demand/reduce supply
- Peg Stability Module (PSM): Direct 1:1 swap with USDC (controversial but effective)

Competitive Advantage
1. First Mover & Battle-Tested: Launched 2017, survived multiple market crashes (March 2020 'Black Thursday,' 2022 bear market). No exploits of core protocol.

2. Network Effects: DAI is the most integrated stablecoin in DeFi. Used as base pair on Uniswap, Curve, Aave, Compound. Deep liquidity = low slippage.

3. Decentralization: No admin keys, no off-switch. More decentralized than USDC/USDT (centralized issuers) and algorithmic stables (single points of failure).

4. RWA Innovation: Pioneered bringing US Treasuries on-chain. $2B+ in RWAs generating 4-5% yield, passed to DAI holders via DSR.

5. Institutional Grade: BlockTower, Monetalis, Huntingdon Valley Bank have formal RWA arrangements. Regulatory clarity (not a security per SEC guidance).

6. Governance Legitimacy: Active governance with 50+ MKR holders regularly voting. Delegate system for passive holders. Transparent on-chain execution.

Traction & Metrics
  TVL: $5.8B — #2 in DeFi behind Lido ($20B)
  DAI Supply: ~$5B — Largest decentralized stablecoin
  Annual Revenue: $150M+ — From stability fees + RWA yield
  Protocol Surplus: $80M+ — Treasury buffer before MKR burns
  RWA Collateral: $2.1B — US Treasuries, corporate bonds
  Vault Count: ~15,000 — Active debt positions
  Market Share: 28% — Of DeFi lending TVL
  DSR Deposits: $1.2B — DAI earning savings rate

TOKENOMICS
───────────────────────────────────────
Token Utility
MKR serves three functions:

1. Governance: Vote on all protocol parameters including:
   - Collateral types and risk parameters
   - Stability fees and DSR rates
   - Protocol upgrades and treasury allocation
   - RWA partner approvals

2. Backstop (Lender of Last Resort): If liquidations don't cover bad debt, new MKR is minted and auctioned to cover the shortfall. This dilutes MKR holders, aligning incentives with proper risk management.

3. Value Accrual: Protocol surplus is used to buy back and burn MKR. This creates deflationary pressure when the protocol is profitable. Over $50M in MKR has been burned historically.

Supply & Distribution
  Initial Distribution (2017): 1,000,000 MKR — Sold to early backers
  Burned (Cumulative): ~22,000 MKR — From surplus auctions
  Foundation/DAO: ~84,000 MKR — Treasury holdings
  Current Supply: ~977,000 MKR — Deflationary

Current circulating: ~900,000 MKR (fully unlocked, no vesting)
Max supply: No hard cap (can mint for debt auctions), but deflationary in normal operations
Inflation rate: Net deflationary when protocol is profitable
Upcoming unlocks: None — MKR was fully distributed in 2017

Value Accrual
Revenue flows:
1. Stability Fees from Vaults → Protocol Surplus
2. RWA Yield → Protocol Surplus (or DSR distribution)
3. Liquidation Penalties → Protocol Surplus

Once surplus exceeds buffer target ($50M), excess is used to buy and burn MKR via Surplus Auctions. In 2024-2025, strong RWA yields have accelerated burns. Current burn rate: ~5,000 MKR/year at current revenue levels.

Sky/Endgame Transition: MKR can be converted to SKY at 1:24,000 ratio. Some governance moving to SKY tokens, but MKR remains valid and continues burning.

TEAM & BACKERS
───────────────────────────────────────
Team
MakerDAO Foundation (dissolved 2021): Originally led by Rune Christensen (founder, still active in governance).

Current Structure: Fully decentralized, operated through Core Units (teams funded by governance):
- Protocol Engineering: Smart contract development
- Risk: Collateral onboarding and risk assessment
- Oracles: Price feed infrastructure
- Growth: Business development, RWA partnerships

Key Contributors: Recognized delegates and domain experts guide governance but no single team controls the protocol.

Investors
Original Backers (2017): Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Polychain Capital, 1confirmation, Distributed Capital Partners.

No recent raises — MakerDAO is fully bootstrapped via protocol revenue. The $80M+ surplus buffer acts as treasury. RWA partners (BlockTower, Monetalis) are counterparties, not investors.

Community & Governance
- Twitter: @MakerDAO — 280K followers
- Discord: ~25,000 members
- Governance Forum: forum.makerdao.com — 500+ active posters
- Governance Participation: ~50 MKR holders vote regularly, ~$100M in delegated MKR

Developer Activity: Core protocol is stable (minimal changes needed). Focus shifted to SubDAOs (Spark for lending), RWA integration, and Layer 2 expansion.

═══════════════════════════════════════
RISKS
───────────────────────────────────────
Regulatory Risk (MEDIUM)
Stablecoins face increasing regulatory scrutiny. However, DAI's decentralized nature provides some protection compared to USDC/USDT. RWA arrangements with US banks suggest growing regulatory acceptance. EU MiCA regulations may require compliance adjustments.

Smart Contract Risk (LOW)
Core contracts are 6+ years old and heavily audited. No major exploits. However, new modules (RWA adapters, PSM) expand attack surface. $5B+ TVL makes it a constant target.

Collateral Risk (MEDIUM)
Heavy reliance on USDC in PSM creates centralization risk — Circle could blacklist MakerDAO. RWAs introduce counterparty risk (what if BlockTower fails?). Protocol has reduced USDC exposure but still significant.

Competition Risk (MEDIUM)
Ethena's USDe grew to $2B in months with higher yields. Aave GHO gaining traction. If competitor stablecoin achieves better DeFi integrations or higher yield sustainably, DAI could lose market share.

Governance Risk (LOW)
Governance is slow and contentious at times. Sky/Endgame transition has divided community. However, this deliberation also prevents rash decisions. No single entity can override governance.
