Create a deep-dive research document for the protocol: {{protocol}}

## Instructions

1. Read the template structure from `_templates/shortlist-deep-dive-template.docx` using mammoth/node to understand the format

2. Research "{{protocol}}" using web search to gather:
   - What the protocol does and how it works
   - Market/sector data (TAM, competitors, market share)
   - Current metrics (TVL, volume, revenue, users)
   - Tokenomics (utility, supply, distribution, vesting, value accrual)
   - Team and backers
   - Risks and upcoming catalysts

3. Determine the category (e.g., perp-dex, lending, liquid-staking)

4. Generate the .docx file at `01-shortlist/[category]/[protocol].docx` using the docx npm package, matching the template structure

5. Remove the protocol from `00-radar/radar-list.docx`

6. Confirm: where file was saved, key metrics found, and that radar was updated
